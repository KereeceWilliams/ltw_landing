<h1>Who is Love the World?</h2>
</div>
<p> Love The World is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to improving the lives of humans, animals and the earth. Our diverse team comes from many different backgrounds with the common goal of helping the world and all of its inhabitants. We organize events that collect donations to give to other charities.</p>
<p>We are currently in the process of planning our second annual Mountain Hike. This hike is one of our biggest events of the year and brings together a vast amount of the community.  Our Mountain Hike occurs in Lawton, Oklahoma at Mt. Scott. Teams from all over Oklahoma participate in this Hike for a great cause.</p>
<p>Our events aim to not only raise funds to support different charities, but to also spread information about the charities, what they support, and what your contributions will be used for.</p>
<p>You are able to sign up with teams on our website, and each team has a team leader.  If you are not able to run in the race, you are also able to sign up as a “virtual hiker” and you will make a donation online without participating in the race. You will still receive a T-Shirt!</p>
<p>If you are a food vendor and plan on participating, you can register for the event through our website as well.</p>
